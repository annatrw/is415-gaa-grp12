    "text": "Introduction\nAirbnb has achieved considerable global success with its short-term home-sharing business model, providing travellers with convenient and cost-effective accommodation options. Beijing, as one of the world’s largest cities and a popular tourist destination in China, is an ideal location to explore the impact of Airbnb on local communities, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting changes in travel patterns. Our project aims to compare Airbnb listing data in Beijing before and after the COVID-19 outbreak to understand how the pandemic has affected Airbnb activity and to identify the spatial patterns of listings in the city."

The hypothesis is as follows: - H0: The distribution of Airbnb Listings in beijing are randomly distributed. - H1: The distribution of Airbnb Listings are not randomly distributed.\n\n\n\n2.0 Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis\nWe will aim to analyse the high and low clustering of airbnb listings in Beijing, determine if there is significant clustering on a global and local level as well as conduct Local Indicators of Spatial Correlation analysis that identifies regions that are positively or negatively correlated to each other.\nAdditionally, Emerging Hot Spot Analysis can be conducted to determine how hot and cold spots change over time, particularly with the variation during the pandemic period."

It provides policy recommendations on regulating short-term rental businesses based on a neighbourhood’s price sensitivity.\n\nThe Value of Location for Airbnb Apartments: A Hedonic Analysis of Airbnb Listing Price in Beijing \n\nThis paper investigates the locational factors affecting Airbnb listings in Beijing and aims to verify a hedonic pricing theory - a model that states both internal and external characteristics and factors determines an item’s price in the market - using spatial econometrics models on Airbnb apartments. It aims to determine if the price of Airbnb apartments are dependent on location, and quantify the effects of proximity to amenities like city centres, tourist attractions and transport facilities.\n\n\nMajority of current studies are looking at Airbnb listings from a price standpoint, and little geospatial research has been done on Airbnb listings in Beijing during Covid. We aim to offer a geospatial analysis perspective of Beijing’s Airbnb apartments that will reveal important spatial patterns that can be considered either on individual level in terms of considering future locations of Airbnb apartments,  or on a policy level in terms of regulating rental businesses like Airbnb post Covid."
