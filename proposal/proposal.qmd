# Spatial Point Pattern Analysis of Airbnb listings in Beijing: A pre and post COVID-19 comparison

# Introduction

Airbnb has achieved considerable global success with its short-term home-sharing business model, providing travellers with convenient and cost-effective accommodation options. **Beijing**, as one of the world's largest cities and a popular tourist destination in China, is an ideal location to explore the impact of Airbnb on local communities, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting changes in travel patterns. Our project aims to compare Airbnb listing data in Beijing **before and after the COVID-19 outbreak** to understand how the pandemic has affected Airbnb activity and to identify the spatial patterns of listings in the city.

# Objectives

## 1.0 Spatial Point Patterns Analysis

### 1.1 First-order Spatial Point Patterns Analysis

**Kernel Density Estimation Analysis**: We could develop kernel density estimation analysis on Airbnb's listing before and after covid, this could provide us valuable insights into the spatial distribution of Beijing's Airbnb, identifying the hotspots for tourism, and see if the covid has changed this pattern and figure out the reason behind it.

### 1.2 Second-order Spatial Point Patterns Analysis

After we analysed the spatial point patterns, we have to confirm the observations statistically by choosing representative study areas using L function. The hypothesis is as follows: 
- H0: The distribution of Airbnb Listings in beijing are randomly distributed. 
- H1: The distribution of Airbnb Listings are not randomly distributed.

## 2.0 Network Constrained Spatial Point Pattern Analysis

We will analyse the point events - location of Airbnb listings in Beijing that occurs alongside the local road network.

### 2.1 Network Constrained KDE Analysis
Using network constrained KDE analysis, it will visualise the road segments where higher density of Airbnb listings are located at. Before and after Covid KDE maps will be available for comparison.

### 2.2 Network Constrained G, K function Analysis


### 2.3 Cross K function Analysis
Ho = The distribution of Airbnb listings before and after Covid are spatially independent.

H1= The distribution of Airbnb listings before and after Covid are NOT spatially independent.

The null hypothesis will be rejected if p-value is smaller than alpha value of 0.001 (i.e. at 99.9% confident interval).

    -   This paper investigates how Beijing's Airbnb apartments are affecting housing prices in the region with the use of a machine learning model to analyse price sensitivity as a result of increasing Airbnb activities in Beijing. It provides policy recommendations on regulating short-term rental businesses based on a neighbourhood's price sensitivity.

    -   This paper investigates the locational factors affecting Airbnb listings in Beijing and aims to verify a hedonic pricing theory - a model that states both internal and external characteristics and factors determines an item's price in the market - using spatial econometrics models on Airbnb apartments. It aims to determine if the price of Airbnb apartments are dependent on location, and quantify the effects of proximity to amenities like city centres, tourist attractions and transport facilities.

Majority of current studies are looking at Airbnb listings from a price standpoint, and little geospatial research has been done on Airbnb listings in Beijing during Covid. We aim to offer a geospatial analysis perspective of Beijing's Airbnb apartments that will reveal important spatial patterns that can be considered either on individual level in terms of considering future locations of Airbnb apartments,  or on a policy level in terms of regulating rental businesses like Airbnb post Covid.
